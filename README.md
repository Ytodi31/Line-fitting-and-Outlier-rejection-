## LineFitting and Outlier rejection
								 

-Two dimensional data points have been fit into a line using different Linear least square techniques including 
1. Line fitting using Linear Least Squares
2. Least Square Estimation with Regularisation

The code accpets 2D data points in the form of .pkl files and can be given as input in Line 5 of code (main.py)

-Expected outputs:
1. Plot of Eigen vectors
2. Line fitting using least squares
3. Line fitting after outlier rejection
